# Project-2-Web-Scraped-Data-Analysis-and-Visualizations
This project analyzes team performance in the NHL Metropolitan Division during the 2024–2025 season, with a specific focus on comparing the New Jersey Devils and the New York Rangers.

#### This project demonstrates the ability to:

Clean and analyze real world sports data

Perform statistical comparisons

Build meaningful data visualizations

Apply good coding practices in a structured Jupyter Notebook

#### The analysis answers the following questions:

How do the Devils’ overall standings metrics (wins, losses, points) compare with the Rangers?

How does the Devils’ goal differential compared to the Rangers and the rest of the Metro Division?

How do the Devils’ and Rangers’ special teams (Power Play % and Penalty Kill %) compare to each other and the rest of the division?

How consistent is the Devils’ scoring (goals per game) compared to the Rangers and the Metro Division average?
